# A class can be thought as a classroom

# An object is essentially any physical thing like a circle
# or a student

# Objects have a 1) a unique identity, 2) data fields and 3) methods

# 1) All objects created in python are assigned a
# unique ID that the uses a reference. Think about it as
# a Social Security number for a person

# 2) States/properties/attributes are represented by
#  by variables called data fields. These are properties
# that characterize the object. For circle, data field: radius
# for a person, data filed: sex, gender, height, weight, nationality,

# 3) Methods are things that the object can do using the data fields
# It essentially describes the objects behavior/actions.
# For a circle you can use the radius to find: perimeter, area.
# This is executed by: getaction(). Ex: getarea() is a method
# that returns the area.
# For a person you can use the info (basically resume) to see what
# career they will be interested in and therefore predict what they
# will do: save lives, build stuff, design stuff, sing stuff etc..
