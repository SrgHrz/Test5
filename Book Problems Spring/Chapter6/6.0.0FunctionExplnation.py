# 1) First define the function
#    def functionName(list of parameters):
#    #function body

# 2) Then Define the stuff that goes in the function body
#    def main():
#
# 3) Then call the function. This executes the function.
#    main()

# Order to read: 3 -> 2 -> 1
# because function # 1 and function #2 are stored in memory
# you can actually define them in the reverse order and things
# will still be fine

# if a function returns a value then it's called a "value returning
# function" and the keyword: return is required to return the result
