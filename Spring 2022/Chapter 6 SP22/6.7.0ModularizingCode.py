# First I will open a new file and save it as MyModule,
# exactly the same name I will  use to import it
# Inside of this file I will write a very basic function that I
# can reuse by importing it
#
# def myFunc(x):
    #return x + 5

# # Then after saving the file,
# I will open a new file a save it as tutorialModule.py
# Then type the following:
#
# import myModule
# print(myModule.myFunc(6))

# Then after saving the file, I can run it
