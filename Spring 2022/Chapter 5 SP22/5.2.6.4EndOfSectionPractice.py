# Show the errors in the following code:
print("a")

count = 0
while count < 100:
    print(count)
# The problem with this is that this is an infinite loop
# The number 0 will always be less than 100 thus this is the value
# that will always be printed

# The value of count is not changed, thus
# it will never be allowed to be greater than 0
