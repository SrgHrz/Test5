# a "for loop" iterates through each number in the sequence

# often you know how many times the loop body needs to be executed
# so a control variable can be used to control the number of executions

# In general the loop can be written as follows:

# i = initial value
# while i < endValue:
    # Loop Body
    # ...
    # i += 1 # Adjust the loop controlled variable

# The for loop can be used to simplify the previous loop:

# for variable in sequence:
    # loop body
