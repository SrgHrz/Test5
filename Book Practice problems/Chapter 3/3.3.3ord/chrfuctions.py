# What the ordinal function: ord() does is if i put in a character
# then it converts the character into a number (ASCI code)
# Essentially: Give me the number for this letter
# ch = 'a'
# ord(ch) = ord('a') ----> 97


# The chr: chr() function does the opposite
# If I put in a number (ASCII code) into the function, then it
# spits out a character represented by the number
# Essentially: Give me the letter fot this number

# chr(98) -----> 'b'
