# This int function converts the boolean values to a number
# since 1 represents True, and 0 represents False
print(int(True)) #result is 1
print(int(False)) #result is 0
print(bool(0)) #result is false
print(bool(1)) #result is true
print("......")
i = int(True) # makes i = 1 (the integer value of true)
print("i is", i)
